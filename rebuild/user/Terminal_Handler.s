; Terminal Handler Process 
; This process handles intake from the terminal and determines how to respond

    ; R10 is used to tell the process if it an echo input or not 1 is echo 0 is not echo 
    ; R11 is used to store address of RxD buffer start  
    ; R12 is used to store address of buffer start
